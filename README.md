# AutoClicker
Windows Forms AutoClicker C#

An auto clicker made for fun over a few days, as a classmate suggested I should make my own auto clicker.
The code is somewhat clean, but the logic should optimally be seperated from the UI, which isn't done here.

## Features
 - Clicks per second display
 - Clean dark interface (for the most part)
 - Statistics such as per session total clicks, and all time total clicks
 - Optional feature to make the window always stay on top of all other programs
 - Saves user preferences and statistics
 - Configurable toggle keybinds
 - Configurable timeout

## To-do list
 - Disable auto clicker on right mouse button
 - Lock mouse while auto clicker is enabled
 - Fix elements that still have a bright bagground color
 - Seperate logic from UI code
